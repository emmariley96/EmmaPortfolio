  <h1>Welcome to my Portfolio!</h1>
  <h2>About Me:</h2>
  <p>My name is Emma Riley, I am 26 years old, and I am teaching myself to code. I am currently an Account Manager at TikTok, and my current role peaked my interest in coding. I often work with Website Pixels to help my clients track their events, and I am especially interested in the coding. Therefore, I decided to learn how to code, not only because I was interested, but also for a potential career progression. I am currently using FreeCodeCamp and SheCodes to learn, and am looking to expand my network.</P.
